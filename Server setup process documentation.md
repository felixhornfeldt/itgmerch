## Django server deployment + email server on Linux
The purpose of this document is to serve as a reference log to the setup process that I will be undergoing to install and set up mod_WSGI, Postfix and Dovecot on Debian Linux.  
Hopefully this document will allow me and others to get started quicker when doing this next time.

### Preparation
For this setup I will be needing a few packages.  
These are:
+ Dovecot
+ Postfix
+ mod_WSGI (make needed)
+ python3
+ Django
+ Apache web server
